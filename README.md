### Notes

There was an app crash problem when clicking on the detail views, so I tried to take a look into Logcat and found there was a NullPointerException in DetailActivity.java. I tried some solutions such as try-catch, string-valueof, if-else, and finally I solved the problem by simply correcting the typo from tvTitle to tvOverView.

### Notes
In the middle of writing the code, the emulator did not run suddenly. I solved the problem by reinstalling Android Studio and cleaning & rebuilding the project.
